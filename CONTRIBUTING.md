# Maintaining the Repository

Keep canonical skill directories categorized under `skills/`. Expose each skill through a relative symlink in the cross-client `.agents/skills/` directory:

```text
skills/
├── planning/
├── tools/
├── utilities/
└── workflows/

skills/<category>/<skill-name>/
├── SKILL.md            # Required metadata and core instructions
├── agents/             # Optional client-specific UI metadata
├── scripts/            # Optional executable helpers
├── references/         # Optional documentation loaded on demand
└── assets/             # Optional templates and static resources

.agents/skills/<skill-name> -> ../../skills/<category>/<skill-name>
```

For each change:

1. Choose the narrowest existing category; add a category only when several related skills need it.
2. Keep the canonical directory name, symlink name, and frontmatter `name` identical and lowercase with hyphens.
3. Create symlinks relative to `.agents/skills/` so they remain valid in every clone.
4. Make `description` explain both capability and activation context.
5. Keep `SKILL.md` focused and under 500 lines; move conditional detail into directly linked resource files.
6. Confirm skills.sh discovery before publishing:

   ```bash
   npx skills add . --list
   ```

## Next-step handoff convention

Every delivery-workflow skill ends its final report with a `Next step:` line — one exact copy-pasteable command for the follow-up, selected from the run's actual outcome with real arguments, never placeholders; omit it only when no follow-up exists. Each skill states the canonical tail verbatim: "Recommend only — never invoke it. It is the report's last line; if several must run, end with a numbered list in run order." Apply this convention when adding or changing workflow skills.
